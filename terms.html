                Once an order has been submitted your credit card will be charged. Our ordering process is streamlined so your order will immediately be sent to processing and then shipping. Due to
                the high volume of orders we receive we will be unable to cancel an order after submitted. The customers DO NOT have to return the trial bottle back if they cancel within
                the {{product.totalLength}} day trial period. Please order carefully.
            </p>

            <h3>Terms and Conditions for Autoship Customers</h3>
    
            <p>
                Initially, just pay {{product.shippingPrice | currency}} for S&amp;H today to fully evaluate {{product.name}} for {{product.totalLength}} days ({{product.trialLength}} days plus {{product.shippingLength}}
                days for shipping via USPS). You will be billed as <b>{{product.descriptor}}</b>. If you like the product, simply keep it. Once your trial has ended {{product.totalLength}} days from the initial date,
                you will be billed {{product.rebillPrice | currency}} unless you cancel your order within {{product.totalLength}} days. Then, every 30 days thereafter (i.e. day {{product.totalLength
                + 30}}, day {{product.totalLength + 60}} etc.) you will continue in the monthly program and be billed {{product.rebillPrice -2 | currency}} (Free Shipping). 
                There is no shipping and handling cost for recurring payments. You can cancel any time by emailing {{product.email}} or calling: 
            </p>
            <p>
                US {{product.phoneNumber}}
            </p>
    
            </p>
            and let us know you would like to cancel and you will not be charged anything other than the initial fee. You can also cancel by filling out our <a href="cancellation.html" target='_self'>Cancellation Form</a> and providing your contact details and order id. This means that every 30 days you will be shipped a new 1 month supply of {{product.name}}
            and the low monthly fee will be charged. This is a reoccurring order that will take place each month until you choose to cancel the program. *I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS CONSUMER
            TRANSACTION INVOLVES A NEGATIVE OPTION, AND THAT I MAY BE LIABLE FOR PAYMENT OF FUTURE GOODS AND SERVICES UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT IF I FAIL TO NOTIFY THE SUPPLIER
            NOT TO SUPPLY THE GOODS OR SERVICES DESCRIBED.*
            </p>
    
            <p>You must provide ample time to process any request to cancel recurring charges.</p>
    
            <p>
                You agree by submitting your information for membership to {{product.name}} that the Company's maximum liability is limited to the total amount paid by you for the initial and monthly
                fees, regardless of extenuating circumstances. If you have any concern regarding the products or services, trials included, or other fees charged, you must elect to not
                order from this website. By ordering from this website you certify that you have been notified of this limitation of liability and agree with it.</p>
    
            <p>
                If at any time you are unsatisfied with the products or service provided, it is your responsibility to notify Company to allow Company to rectify any problems or cancel your auto-ship
                program. As this program is provided on a month-to-month basis, it is your responsibility to notify Company prior to payment of monthly fees. Payment of ongoing monthly
                fees by you shall signify your satisfaction with your membership, previous months billing, and all products and services provided up to that point.</p>
    
            <p>
                You agree to the use of electronic records to evidence this agreement. If you do not agree to the use of electronic records, you must elect to not order from this website. In such event,
                this will be null and void. Your consent applies to all transactions including monthly fees. You hereby waive any objection you may have to Company's use of electronic records
                in court should it be necessary to enforce the terms of this agreement.</p>
